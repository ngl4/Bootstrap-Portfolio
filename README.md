# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Responsive Assignment: Bootstrap


### Assignment One Instructions (Bootstrap)

1. Inside your `Bootstrap-Portfolio` repo, create `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

2. Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)

     * eg. On `xs` and `sm` screens, content should take up the entire screen. On `md` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!

   * Responsive images

   **BONUS**
   Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site _(Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)_


   #Reflection

   What I have learnt from this assignment is not only to sometimes override bootstrap code slightly, but also to think of another simplier way to code. Learning to code simplier is crucial and challenging, but it will be an extremely useful skills to have for my future career. 

   For example, we might want to use bg-primary in bootstrap to change colors, but it can cause different issues in terms of other pseudo-classes effect. As a result, an easier solution is to create a class or an id in your own css stylesheet and then change the background-color and other hovering effect, etc.
