# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Responsive Design: Bootstrap

Based on the preivous [Basic-Portfolio](https://ngl4.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/) design, this portfolio recreates Basic-Portfolio with Bootstrap. 

   ### Reflection:

   What I have learnt from this Bootstrap-Portfolio is not only to sometimes override bootstrap code slightly, but also to think of another simplier way to code. Learning to code simplier is crucial and challenging, but it will be an extremely useful skills to have for my future career. 

   For example, we might want to use bg-primary in bootstrap to change colors, but it can cause different issues in terms of other pseudo-classes effect. As a result, an easier solution is to create a class or an id in your own css stylesheet and then change the background-color and other hovering effect, etc.
